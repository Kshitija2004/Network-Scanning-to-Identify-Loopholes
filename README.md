# Network-Scanning-to-Identify-Loopholes
Network scanning is a systematic process used in cybersecurity to discover, analyze, and evaluate devices, services, and vulnerabilities present in a network.

* Performed network scanning and vulnerability identification using the Nmap tool.

* Identified live hosts within the target network using host discovery techniques.

* Conducted port scanning on live hosts to detect open, closed, and filtered ports.

* Used service and version detection to identify running services and software versions.

* Performed aggressive scanning to gather detailed system information including OS details and network paths.

* Executed vulnerability scanning using Nmap NSE scripts to detect known security weaknesses.

* Analyzed scan results to understand the network attack surface and security loopholes.

* All scans were conducted in a controlled and authorized environment following ethical hacking practices.
